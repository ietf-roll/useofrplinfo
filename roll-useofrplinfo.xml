   This document states different cases where RFC 6553, RFC 6554 and IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation is required to set the
   bases to help defining the compression of RPL routing information in LLN environments.

  	<section title="Introduction">
	     <t>
		RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> defines RPL Option to transmit routing information. RFC 6553 <xref target="RFC6553"/> defines how to transmit in a Hop-By-Hop Option RPL Information,such as 			information to avoid and detect loops. RFC 6554 <xref target="RFC6554"/> defines the use of Extension header for Source Routing.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		Several discussions in ML took place focusing in the definition how to compress RPL Information in constrained environments,
		the Conclusion was that there is a need to define how to use RFC 6553, RFC6554 and tunneling (IP-in-IP) to be able to set the correct environment to define the compression on these 			techniques.
		ROLL Virtual Interim Meeting (2014) concluded that a document stating the use of this Extension headers would be useful for further proccessing on it, e.g. to compress them.

       <section title="sample/reference topology">
        	<t>
		In a typical topology we found 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router), 6lR (6LoWPAN Router) and 6LN (6LoWPAN Node) as leaf connected in a DODAG (Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph)
		Between these entities messages such as DIS, DIO and DAO are transmitted.
		RPL defines the RPL Control message as an ICMPv6 information message with a Type of 155.
		RPL supports two modes of Downward traffic: Storing, it is fully stateful or Non-Storing it is fully source routed.  Any given RPL Instance is either storing or non-storing.

			this message is going to be analyzed in each node until arrive the DODAG root.

		        <t>
			RFC 6554 was created to strictly send information between RPL routers in the same RPL routing domain. How it would be in 6554?

			TBD: Tunneling is necessary in case that there is information to send outside RPL Domain and other cases?
